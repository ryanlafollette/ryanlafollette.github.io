            <p>Elijah&nbsp;Mullenax is an up and coming creator. 
                Originally from Brevard, North Carolina, now living in Carrboro, 
                he's an aspiring author and spends much of his time writing fiction.

                a coming of age story involving the combination of art and magic with unforseen consequences.
                When he's not writing stories, you can catch him writing and playing folk music on his guitar, 
                busking in the Chapel Hill/Carrboro area.<br><br>
